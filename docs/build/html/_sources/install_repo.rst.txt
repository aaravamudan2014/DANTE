Package installation
====================

The ability to use this package anywhere as an import is quite useful since users aren't exposed to the relative file organization within the repository.

This tutorial goes over how get a running example using imports from this library.

Firstly, if you prefer working in a virtual environemnt, 
make sure that you are in your environment. 
If you are working with conda environment, 
make sure it is activated and if you working with a pip env, make sure that the virtual env folder is either outside the repository or if it inside the repository, include it in the `.gitignore` file.


Change directory to the base directory (directory containing the README.md) 
and install all the packages from the
requirements.txt file. Then, install the existing library using `pip install` as follows.

.. code-block:: console

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   
The second `pip install` command will download the current project as its own package. This can be verified using the following commnad. 

.. code-block:: console

   pip list
